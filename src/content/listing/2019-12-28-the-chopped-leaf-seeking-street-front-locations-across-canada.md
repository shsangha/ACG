Header: 'Tenant Mandate: Seeking Retail Storefronts'
Description: "Tenant seeking street front retail locations from 1,200 SF to 1,500 SF for their aggressive expansion plans underway across Canada.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe Chopped Leaf introduced its healthy fast food concept of chef designed salads, wraps and soups to Kelowna in 2008. This new restaurant created a lot of buzz and the franchise has grown to over 58 locations open or under construction throughout Canada. It all began when founder, Blair Stevens, saw a gap in the quick service industry for people to grab a healthy meal on the go. He took his restaurant a step above fast food expectations to create an upscale restaurant concept serving premium produce and proteins that are paired with private label dressings, soups and bakery items. The Chopped Leaf's recipe to success is to keep it simple and stick to its values. For more information on bringing The Chopped Leaf to your area contact Chris Wills at 205 870 1330.

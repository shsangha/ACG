Description: >-
  The Chopped Leaf introduced its healthy fast food concept of chef designed
  salads, wraps and soups to Kelowna in 2008. This new restaurant created a lot
  of buzz and the franchise has grown to over 58 locations open or under
  construction throughout Canada. It all began when founder, Blair Stevens, saw
  a gap in the quick service industry for people to grab a healthy meal on the
  go. He took his restaurant a step above fast food expectations to create an
  upscale restaurant concept serving premium produce and proteins that are
  paired with private label dressings, soups and bakery items. The Chopped
  Leaf's recipe to success is to keep it simple and stick to its values. For
